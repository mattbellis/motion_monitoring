LOWWALK file, I walked from 131, through the first floor, up to the second and third floors of RB, made my way outside and walked from RB to the MAC and to Admissions before I reset the arduino.

FASTWALK was created and that was from Admissions, between Ryan and Hennepin, past Saga, SSU and Padua. Walked between Hines and SSU, past Kiernan to the front of Siena Hall and then went inside. Walked through the middle doors then up to the third floor and walked towards the staircase closest to Foy. Walked by Foy and through the back entrance to RB, through the first floor towards Morrell.

STUMWALK, I was pretending to stumble. Walked through MC first floor, up to the second floor, back down to the walkway that connects MC to the first floor of RB, then up to the second, third, and fourth floors before coming back to 131.

BELWALK1, 2, and 3 is all of the data taken while walking with you. The first one was ended when we were in Cummings' office, which started the second one, but I restarted the board when we were walking from the second floor of MC to the first because it was acting weird.
